I'm Sanjay Vardhan, a Final Year CS Undergrad at Amrita University, Amritapuri Campus.

I like systems security, low-level development and exploitation. I'm an active CTF player and Team Lead @teambi0s. My current skills include linux userspace exploitation (stack and heap-based) and browser exploitation (V8, JSC).
